## How it works ‚Äì pg_index_pilot architecture and principles

The system uses an optimized "fire-and-forget" approach for `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY` that prevents deadlocks while maintaining secure password management through postgres_fdw.

**How it works:**
1. **Connection Management**: 
   - dblink connection established via postgres_fdw USER MAPPING (no plain-text passwords)
   - Connection created in procedure (not function) so it survives commit statements
   - Connection kept alive for reuse across multiple indexes

2. **Deadlock Prevention**:
   - `commit` to release all locks before starting reindex
   - Execute synchronous `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY` via `dblink_exec()`
   - REINDEX runs in separate transaction via dblink (no lock conflicts)
   - Connection kept alive for reuse across multiple indexes

3. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Records start time before reindex operation
   - Waits for completion (synchronous operation)
   - Immediately records final size and duration after completion
   - No periodic job needed - all tracking is real-time

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ No deadlocks (proper lock management with commit)
- ‚úÖ No hanging or timeouts (reliable synchronous operation)
- ‚úÖ Immediate completion tracking (no waiting for periodic jobs)
- ‚úÖ Secure password management via postgres_fdw
- ‚úÖ Works on managed services (RDS, Cloud SQL, Azure)

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Sequential processing (one index at a time per connection)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires procedure support (PostgreSQL 11+)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs postgres_fdw for secure connections

This architecture specifically addresses the challenge of running `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY` from within a transaction context while maintaining security, preventing deadlocks, and providing reliable completion tracking.

## Managed Services Setup

pg_index_pilot fully supports managed PostgreSQL services with optimized fire-and-forget architecture.

### Prerequisites for Managed Services

1. PostgreSQL 12.0 or higher
2. `dblink` extension installed
3. `pg_cron` extension (optional, for scheduling)
4. User with index ownership or appropriate permissions

### Installation on Managed Services

Use the manual installation as described above. The system automatically detects managed service environment and configures appropriately.

### Verification and Testing

After installation, run the test script to verify everything works:

```bash
psql -h your-instance.region.rds.amazonaws.com -U index_pilot -d your_database -f test_rds_installation.sql
```

### Manual REINDEX Testing

Test the fire-and-forget REINDEX on a small index:

```sql
-- Test REINDEX on a specific index
call index_pilot.do_reindex(
    current_database(),
    'schema_name',
    'table_name', 
    'index_name',
    false  -- force = false (only if bloat detected)
);

-- Check active REINDEX processes
select count(*) from pg_stat_activity 
where query ilike '%REINDEX%' and state = 'active';

-- Check reindex history
select 
    schemaname, relname, indexrelname,
    pg_size_pretty(indexsize_before::bigint) as size_before,
    pg_size_pretty(indexsize_after::bigint) as size_after,
    reindex_duration,
    entry_timestamp
from index_pilot.reindex_history 
order by entry_timestamp desc 
limit 5;
```

## Testing Results

The system has been thoroughly tested on managed PostgreSQL services with the following results:

### ‚úÖ **Successfully Tested Features:**
- **Fire-and-forget REINDEX CONCURRENTLY** - No hanging or timeouts
- **Secure FDW connections** - Using postgres_fdw USER MAPPING
- **Automatic bloat detection** - Maxim Boguk's formula working correctly
- **History tracking** - Complete reindex operations logged
- **Permission management** - Proper grant usage on postgres_fdw

### üìä **Performance Results:**
- **Index size reduction:** Up to 85.4% (4.3MB ‚Üí 0.6MB in real test)
- **REINDEX duration:** ~1 minute for medium indexes on managed services
- **Background execution:** No blocking of monitoring functions
- **Memory usage:** Minimal overhead during operation

### üîê **Password Security:**

The system uses **secure postgres_fdw USER MAPPING** for password management:

**How it works:**
1. **Password provided ONCE** during setup (via user mapping to the target server):
   ```sql
   -- Create user mapping for the control DB current_user to a target server
   create user mapping if not exists for current_user server target_your_database
     options (user 'index_pilot', password 'your_secure_password');
   -- Note: Ensure current_user has a user mapping for the FDW server
   ```

2. **Password stored securely** in PostgreSQL catalog via user mapping
3. **No password needed** for subsequent operations:
   ```sql
   call index_pilot.do_reindex(
       current_database(),
       'schema_name',
       'table_name', 
       'index_name',
       false
   );
   -- No password required!
   ```

**Security benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **No plain text passwords** in code or logs
- ‚úÖ **One-time setup** - password entered only during configuration
- ‚úÖ **Automatic authentication** - dblink uses USER MAPPING
- ‚úÖ **PostgreSQL catalog storage** - secure password storage

### üîß **Required Permissions:**

**Self-hosted PostgreSQL:**
```sql
-- Basic permissions (handled by setup_01_user.psql)
grant usage on foreign data wrapper postgres_fdw to index_pilot;
```

**Managed services (RDS/Cloud SQL):**
-- Prefer user mappings on foreign servers and dblink_connect(server_name)

### üöÄ **Production Ready:**
The system is fully tested and ready for production use on both self-hosted PostgreSQL and managed services (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure Database).
