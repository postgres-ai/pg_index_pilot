## Maxim Boguk's formula

Traditional index bloat estimation ([ioguix](https://github.com/ioguix/pgsql-bloat-estimation)) is widely used but has certain limitations:
- only btree indexes are supported (GIN, GiST, hash, HNSW and others are not supported at all)
- it can be quite off in certain cases
- [the non-superuser version](https://github.com/ioguix/pgsql-bloat-estimation/blob/master/btree/btree_bloat.sql) inspects "only index on tables you are granted to read" (requires additional permissions), and in this case it is slow (~1000x slower than [the superuser version](https://github.com/ioguix/pgsql-bloat-estimation/blob/master/btree/btree_bloat-superuser.sql))
- due to its speed, can be challenging to use in database with huge number of indexes.

An alternative approach was developed by Maxim Boguk. It relies on the ratio between index size and `pg_class.reltuples` – Boguk's formula:
```text
bloat indicator = index size / pg_class.reltuples
```

This method is extremely lightweight:
- Index size is always easily available via `pg_indexes_size(indexrelid)`
- `pg_class.reltuples` is also immedialy available and maintained up-to-date by autovacuum/autoanalyze

Boguk's bloat indicator is not measured in bytes or per cents. It is to be used in relative scenario: first, we measure the "ideal" value – the value of freshly built index. And then, we observe how the value changes over time – if it significantly bigger than the "ideal" one, it is time to reindex.

This defines pros and cons of this method.

Pros:
- any type of index is supported
- very lightweight analysis
- better precision than the traditional bloat estimate method for static-width columns (e.g., indexes on `bigint` or `timestamptz` columns), without the need to involve expensive `pgstattuple` scans

Cons:
- initial index rebuild is required (TODO: implement import of baseline values from a fully reindexed clone)
- for VARLENA data types (`text`, `jsonb`, etc), the method's accuracy might be affected by a "avg size drift" – in case of significant change of avg. size of indexed values, the baseline can silently shift, leading to false positive or false negative results in decision to reindex; however for large tables/indexes, the chances of this are very low
